      <h4>visual studio</h4>    
      <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.
           It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile 
           apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows
            Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can 
            produce both native code and managed code.</p>
        <h4>
            console screen
        </h4>  
        <p>
            Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. 
            An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer.
             It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy 
             the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination.
              The text mode is unavailable in 
            Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.
